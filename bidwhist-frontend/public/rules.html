            <h1>Welcome to Bid Whist!</h1>
            <h2>This page contains the rules for the game.</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Bid whist is a partnership trick-taking variant of the classic card game whist. As indicated by the name,
                bid whist adds a bidding element to the game that is not present in classic whist.</p>
            <h3>Game Play</h3>
            <p>The general play of bid whist is similar to that of whist, with four notable exceptions. In whist, the
                trump suit for a given hand is determined at random by the last card dealt, whereas in bid whist, the
                trump suit (or whether there will even be a trump suit) for a given hand is determined by the outcome of
                the bidding process.<br>

                Secondly, whether a trick is won by the higher-ranking card of the winning suit, or by the lower-ranking
                card of that suit is also determined by the outcome of the bidding process.<br>

                Thirdly, since the ace is always the most powerful card (excluding jokers, which are optional), whether
                the ace is the highest-ranking card of the suit or the lowest-ranking card can change from hand to hand,
                depending on whether higher-ranking cards or lower-ranking cards win in that hand. In "uptown" games, in
                which higher cards win tricks over lower cards, the ace is "high," ranking above the king. In "downtown"
                games, in which lower cards take tricks over higher ones, the ace is "low", below the 2 - making it
                again, the best card (excluding jokers if these are used).<br>

                Lastly, the scoring of the game is handled differently from regular Whist.</p>
                <h3>Card Ranking</h3>
                <p>Uptown<br>
                    Trumps: Big joker, little joker, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2<br>
                    Non-trump: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2<br>
                    <br>
                    Downtown<br>
                    Trumps: Big joker, little joker, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K<br>
                    Non-trump: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K</p>
                <h3>Kitty</h3>
                <p>In most variations, a 'kitty' of four, five, or six cards is dealt separately from the cards
                    delivered to each player. If no jokers are being used, the kitty will consist of four cards. If
                    one joker is being used, the kitty will consist of five cards. And if two jokers are being used,
                    the kitty will consist of six cards.<br>
                    <br>
                    The winner of the bid auction can use the kitty. They add these cards to their hand and discard an
                    equal number face down, which technically form the first trick taken of their bid. (This is similar
                    to the skat in Skat.)</p>
                <h3>Bidding</h3>
                <p>After all of the cards have been dealt, but prior to the beginning of game play, each player may
                    submit a bid. If a player chooses not to bid, the player may pass. Just as with the game play,
                    the bidding starts with the player to the dealer's left and proceeds clockwise to each player
                    in turn, ending with the dealer.</p>
                <h3>Playing</h3>
                <p>The objective of the play is to win tricks. A trick consists of four cards, one from the hand of
                    each player, in rotation, the first card played to a trick generally being called the lead. A
                    player is required to follow suit to the card led, if possible. Failure to follow suit when a
                    player has a card of the suit played is called a renege (see Renege below). If the player cannot
                    follow suit, he may play any card.<br><br>

                    Some people play that if the hand is a no trump hand and a player has a joker in his hand, he must
                    throw off the joker the first time a suit is played and the player does not have a card of the suit
                    played. Other players play that if the hand is a no-trump hand, players who have a joker must turn
                    in the joker for one of the discarded cards in the kitty. Many people do not like to play the
                    latter way, because it gives an indication of what suit the bid-taker has discarded.<br><br>

                    For trump bids, it is generally preferred to cut a suit with a trump card when the player cannot
                    follow the suit controlled by the opponents. The highest bidder always plays the first lead card
                    in the game. After this play, the player who won the trick leads off to the player seated at his
                    left. The play continues in this way until all twelve tricks have been played.<br><br>

                    When a trick is completed, i.e., four cards played, a member of the side which won the trick takes
                    the four cards, turns them face down, and places them in front of him in a row. It is customary for
                    one player to take in all the tricks won by his side. The tricks should be kept separated from one
                    another so that any previous trick can be referred to, if necessary. A player may turn and look
                    back at the last trick until he or his partner has led or played to the next player. After that,
                    he may not look at any previous tricks, unless a renege is called.</p>
                <h3>Renege</h3>
                <p>If a player fails to follow suit, e.g., clubs are led, player has a club, but plays a spade (or
                    some other suit), the player has reneged. It is up to the opposing team to spot the renege and call
                    it. If a renege is called, the player calling it must find the specific book where the renege
                    occurred after going through the made books.<br><br>

                    If the player successfully calls the renege, the team reneging loses three tricks (books). If the
                    player calls a renege and cannot identify the exact book where the renege occurred after reviewing
                    the made books, then the team calling the renege loses three tricks</p>
                <h3>Scoring</h3>
                <p>Each team begins the game with a score of zero. At the end of each hand, the bidding team either
                    wins points by making their bid or loses points by failing to take enough books to satisfy their
                    bid (known as being set). The game ends when a team wins by achieving a cumulative score of seven
                    or more, or loses by reaching a cumulative score of minus seven or worse.<br><br>

                    At the end of each hand, the books that the team that won the bid are counted. There are 13
                    altogether, corresponding to the 12 cards played by each player plus the kitty (if one is used),
                    which counts as a book won by the bidder's team. Each book won above six counts toward the team's
                    bid. In order to make their bid, the bidding team must take at least the number of books equal to
                    six plus their bid.<br><br>

                    If the bidding team makes their bid, they score one point for every book they took after the
                    initial six. If they fail to take enough books for their bid, they score nothing for their books,
                    and instead their bid is subtracted from their score. A team may win more than they bid, but may
                    lose only what was bid. In either case, the opponents of the bidding team neither win nor lose any
                    points.<br>
                    Note: If Team A won the bid with a 5 High they must take 11 tricks (Initial 6 plus their bid of 5)
                    to make their bid. If they only take 10 books (the kitty and 9 other books) Team A would have
                    failed their bid (also known as being set) and they would go back 5 points. On the other hand if
                    Team A made 12 books (the kitty plus 11 other books) on our 5 bid, we will score a total of 6
                    points for that hand.<br><br>

                    If a team takes all 13 tricks (initial 6 plus 7), this is commonly called a Boston. A team can
                    make a Boston regardless of the number of tricks that are bid.<br><br>

                    If a player bids 7, this is also called bidding a Boston. In this case, the bidding player is
                    saying that the opposing team will not collect any tricks.<br><br>

                    A no trump bid can sometimes score double (e.g. if you bid a four no trump and do not make the bid,
                    it counts for eight points against your team. Conversely, if you make a four no trump bid, it
                    counts as eight for your team).<br><br>

                    Rather than counting the tricks won, most players keep track of the tricks taken by the opposing
                    team (e.g., it takes four books to set a four, three books to set a five, two books to set a six,
                    and so forth).<br><br>

                    If a team wins a game by bidding a Boston, the total tally for the game counts as two wins.</p>
