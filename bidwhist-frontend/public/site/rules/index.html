          <p>This page contains the rules for the game.</p>
          <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
          <p>
            Bid whist is a partnership trick-taking variant of the classic card
            game whist. As indicated by the name, bid whist adds a bidding
            element to the game that is not present in classic whist.
          </p>
          <h2 id="game-play">Game Play</h2>
          <p>
            The general play of bid whist is similar to that of whist, with four
            notable exceptions. In whist, the trump suit for a given hand is
            determined at random by the last card dealt, whereas in bid whist,
            the trump suit (or whether there will even be a trump suit) for a
            given hand is determined by the outcome of the bidding process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, whether a trick is won by the higher-ranking card of the
            winning suit, or by the lower-ranking card of that suit is also
            determined by the outcome of the bidding process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thirdly, since the ace is always the most powerful card (excluding
            jokers, which are optional), whether the ace is the highest-ranking
            card of the suit or the lowest-ranking card can change from hand to
            hand, depending on whether higher-ranking cards or lower-ranking
            cards win in that hand. In "uptown" games, in which higher cards win
            tricks over lower cards, the ace is "high," ranking above the king.
            In "downtown" games, in which lower cards take tricks over higher
            ones, the ace is "low," below the 2 - making it again, the best card
            (excluding jokers if these are used).
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, the scoring of the game is handled differently from regular
            Whist.
          </p>

          <h4 id="uptown">Uptown</h4>
          <p>
            Trumps: Big joker, little joker, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4,
            3, 2<br />
            Non-trump: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
          </p>
          <h4 id="downtown">Downtown</h4>
          <p>
            Trumps: Big joker, little joker, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J,
            Q, K<br />
            Non-trump: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K
          </p>
          <h2 id="kitty">Kitty</h2>
          <p>
            In most variations, a 'kitty' of four, five, or six cards is dealt
            separately from the cards delivered to each player. If no jokers are
            being used, the kitty will consist of four cards. If one joker is
            being used, the kitty will consist of five cards. And if two jokers
            are being used, the kitty will consist of six cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The winner of the bid auction can use the kitty. They add these
            cards to their hand and discard an equal number face down, which
            technically forms the first trick taken of their bid. (This is
            similar to the skat in Skat.)
          </p>
          <h2 id="bidding">Bidding</h2>
          <p>
            After all the cards have been dealt, but prior to the beginning of
            game play, each player may submit a bid. If a player chooses not to
            bid, the player may pass. Just as with the game play, the bidding
            starts with the player to the dealer's left and proceeds clockwise
            to each player in turn, ending with the dealer.
          </p>
          <h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
          <p>
            The goal of the play is to win tricks. A trick consists of four
            cards, one from the hand of each player, in rotation, the first card
            played to a trick generally being called the lead. A player is
            required to follow suit to the card led, if possible. Failure to
            follow suit when a player has a card of the suit played is called a
            renege (see Renege below). If the player cannot follow suit, he may
            play any card.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people play that if the hand is a no trump hand and a player
            has a joker in his hand, he must throw off the joker the first time
            a suit is played and the player does not have a card of the suit
            played. Other players play that if the hand is a no-trump hand,
            players who have a joker must turn in the joker for one of the
            discarded cards in the kitty. Many people do not like to play the
            latter way, because it gives an indication of what suit the
            bid-taker has discarded.
          </p>
          <p>
            For trump bids, it is generally preferred to cut a suit with a trump
            card when the player cannot follow the suit controlled by the
            opponents. The highest bidder always plays the first lead card in
            the game. After this play, the player who won the trick leads off to
            the player seated at his left. The play continues in this way until
            all twelve tricks have been played.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a trick is completed, i.e., four cards played, a member of the
            side which won the trick takes the four cards, turns them face down,
            and places them in front of him in a row. It is customary for one
            player to take in all the tricks won by his side. The tricks should
            be kept separated from one another so that any previous trick can be
            referred to, if necessary. A player may turn and look back at the
            last trick until he or his partner has led or played to the next
            player. After that, he may not look at any previous tricks, unless a
            renege is called.
          </p>
          <h2 id="renege">Renege</h2>
          <p>
            If a player fails to follow suit, e.g., clubs are led, player has a
            club, but plays a spade (or some other suit), the player has
            reneged. It is up to the opposing team to spot the renege and call
            it. If a renege is called, the player calling it must find the
            specific trick where the renege occurred after going through the
            made tricks.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the player successfully calls the renege, the team reneging loses
            three tricks (tricks). If the player calls a renege and cannot
            identify the exact trick where the renege occurred after reviewing
            the made tricks, then the team calling the renege loses three
            tricks.
          </p>
          <h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
          <p>
            Each team begins the game with a score of zero. At the end of each
            hand, the bidding team either wins points by making their bid or
            loses points by failing to take enough tricks to satisfy their bid
            (known as being set). The game ends when a team wins by achieving a
            cumulative score of seven or more, or loses by reaching a cumulative
            score of minus seven or worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of each hand, the tricks that the team that won the bid
            are counted. There are 13 altogether, corresponding to the 12 cards
            played by each player plus the kitty (if one is used), which counts
            as a trick won by the bidder's team. Each trick won above six counts
            toward the team's bid. To make their bid, the bidding team must take
            at least the number of tricks equal to six plus their bid.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the bidding team makes their bid, they score one point for every
            trick they took after the initial six. If they fail to take enough
            tricks for their bid, they score nothing for their tricks, and
            instead their bid is subtracted from their score. A team may win
            more than they bid, but may lose only what was bid. In either case,
            the opponents of the bidding team neither win nor lose any points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: If Team A won the bid with a 5-bid high, they must take 11
            tricks (Initial 6 plus their bid of 5) to make their bid. If they
            only took 10 tricks (the kitty and 9 other tricks) Team A would have
            failed their bid (also known as being set) and they would go back 5
            points. On the other hand, if Team A made 12 tricks (the kitty plus
            11 other tricks) on our 5 bid, we will score a total of 6 points for
            that hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a team takes all 13 tricks (initial 6 plus 7), this is commonly
            called a Boston. A team can make a Boston regardless of the number
            of tricks that are bid.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a player bids 7, this is also called bidding a Boston. In this
            case, the bidding player is saying that the opposing team will not
            collect any tricks.
          </p>
          <p>
            A no trump bid can sometimes score double (e.g. if you bid a four no
            trump and do not make the bid, it counts for eight points against
            your team. Conversely, if you make a four no trump bid, it counts as
            eight for your team).
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than counting the tricks won, most players keep track of the
            tricks taken by the opposing team (e.g., it takes four tricks to set
            a four, three tricks to set a five, two tricks to set a six, and so
            forth).
          </p>
          <p>
            If a team wins a game by bidding a Boston, the total tally for the
            game counts as two wins.
